The project purpose was to test the result of the 'Neighborhood evaluated adaptive vector filter for suppression of impulse noise in color images'
against classic filters such as median and mean filter when image are altered with Gaussian and Impulse noise. For the implementation of the before
mentioned filter I have followed the article that can be found inside the repository.
